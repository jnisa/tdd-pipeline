## TDD stage

The purpose of this repository is too assure quality in our code along with all the development process. That can be achieve if along the way we perform unitary tests to all the functions produced, indenpendently of the programming language that we are using.

For that matter three strands corresponding to the most used programming languages were created for Python, Java, and Scala.

All in all, whenever we intend to create code for any specific pipeline we should consider using this repository and include multiple tests with different complexities in order to assure the compactness of our code when this gets to the production stage.
